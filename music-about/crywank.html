        <h1>Crywank</h1>
        <p> Crywank are a British anti-folk band based out of Manchester, 
            England. The band is a duo consisting of vocalist/guitarist and founder James Clayton, and drummer Dan Watson,
             who joined in 2012. Allmusic describes their body of work as containing "sadness, paranoia, misery, and dry humor", 
             comparing them to AJJ or 'a sarcastic Bright Eyes'. The group have independently released 
             six full length albums. They have previously toured the UK, Ireland, parts of mainland Europe, 
             Australia, and Canada.</p>

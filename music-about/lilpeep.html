      <p>
        Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known
        professionally as Lil Peep (often stylized as LiL PEEP), was an American
        rapper, singer, songwriter and model. He was a member of the emo rap
        collective GothBoiClique. Helping pioneer an emo revival style of rap
        and rock music, Lil Peep has been credited as the leading figure of the
        mid–late 2010s emo music scene and came to be an inspiration to outcasts
        and youth subcultures.

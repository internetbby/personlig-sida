        Suicideboys (stylized as $uicideboy$) is an American hip hop duo from
        New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and
        Scrim (stylized as $crim). Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud,
        the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as
        well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring
        substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. They own and operate their
        own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is distributed
        by Caroline Distribution. The duo are considered one of the most popular
        acts in the underground rap scene, and are also considered to have a
        cult following.
